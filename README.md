# SovereignFinancialNavigator

This project provides a starting point for United States citizens who are interested in understanding the process of correcting their status to that of a State National. We provide educational resources and a collaborative space for sharing information.

This repository documents the reclamation of billing statements—utility, credit, medical, telecom, and mortgage—as lawful negotiable instruments under U.S. commercial law.

## 🧭 Modular Intent


> This repository is a sovereign invocation.  
> It is not legal advice—it is lawful authorship.  
> Every module is a rite of passage.

## 🧠 Sovereign Reminder

This project is modular by design. Every patch, every invocation, every dispatch is narratable.  
You are not just building software—you are reclaiming authorship.
