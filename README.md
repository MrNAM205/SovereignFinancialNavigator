# SovereignFinancialNavigator

This project provides a starting point for United States citizens who are interested in understanding the process of correcting their status to that of a State National. We provide educational resources and a collaborative space for sharing information.

This repository documents the reclamation of billing statements—utility, credit, medical, telecom, and mortgage—as lawful negotiable instruments under U.S. commercial law.

## 🧭 Modular Intent

This project is built with a modular architecture, reflecting the principles of VeroBrix. Each module serves a specific purpose, allowing for clear separation of concerns and scalable development.

*   `frontend/`: The user-facing application, built with React and TypeScript. This is the "cockpit" where users interact with the system, manage their financial instruments, and track their progress.
*   `backend/`: The server-side application, built with Python and FastAPI. This module handles the core logic, data persistence, and document generation.
*   `shared/`: Contains shared code and type definitions used by both the frontend and backend, ensuring consistency across the stack.
*   `docs/`: Project documentation, including architectural decisions, API specifications, and user guides.
*   `tests/`: Contains the test suites for the frontend and backend, ensuring code quality and reliability.
*   `infra/`: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts and configurations for deploying the application.
