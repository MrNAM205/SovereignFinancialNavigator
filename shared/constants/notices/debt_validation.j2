RE: Account Purportedly Associated with Me

Dear {{ creditor.name }},

This letter is a formal request for validation of the debt you are attempting to collect, pursuant to my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. § 1692g.

Please provide me with the following:
1. The amount of the alleged debt;
2. The name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed;
3. Verification that the debt is not time-barred;
4. A copy of the original signed contract or agreement creating the alleged debt.

Be advised that I am disputing this debt. Until you provide the requested validation, you must cease all collection activities.

This is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent for the purpose of obtaining verification and to ensure my rights are being respected under the law.

Sincerely,

{{ user.full_name }}
